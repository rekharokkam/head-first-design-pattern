2 different patterns are covered in this chapter

Definition
----------
Iterator Pattern - provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representhation.

Composite Pattern - allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Design Principle
----------------

A class should have only one reason to change.
This principle guides to assign only one responsibility to a class and only one class. - SRP - Single Responsibiity Principle
