Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
Proxy - A stand in for a real object.

Three patterns that fall into this category covered in this chapter :

1) Remote Proxy - Controls access to remote object
2) Virtual Proxy - controls access to resource that is expensive to create
3) Protection Proxy - controls access to resource based on access rights.


Proxy Pattern has the following Objects (Class diagram - Pg No. 461)

1) Interface - Subject - has request(). Both real subject and the Proxy Object implement the Subject interface. This allows the client to treat the proxy just like the real object.
2) Real Subject - Remote Object - implements the Subject interface. This Object is the one that does the real work. Proxy controls access to this object.
3) Proxy - implements the Subject interface. 
			Proxy keeps a reference to the subject (real object) so it can forward the requests when necessary. Proxy often instantiates / handles the creation of real subject.
			Proxy can be substituted for a real subject.
			Clients interact with the real subject through the proxy.
			Proxy controls the access to the real subject as
				Real Subject could be running on the remote machine (Remote Proxy)
				Real Subject is expensive to create (Virtual Proxy)
				Real Subject needs to be protected in some way (Dynamic Proxy).
