----------
Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change the class.

Comparison between State and Strategy Pattern
---------------------------------------------

State - Can be thought of as an alternative to putting lots of conditionals in the context object. Change of state causes change of context object behaviour.
Strategy - Can be thought of as an alternative to subclassing. With Strategy, behaviour can be changed during runtime by changing the strategy object composed by the object. (Fly behaviour of ducks)

State - Set of behaviours are encapsulated in a set of State classes. 
		Current state of the context object changes across the defined set of states in the context object there by changing the behaviour of Context object.
		Client has very less or no idea about the state classes.
		
Strategy - Set of behaviours are encapsulated in a set of Strategy classes.
		   Client decides upon the strategy object to be used. (Some of the ducks had flying behaviour and some of them couldnt fly).
		   
State - Client has no control on changing the State object inside of Context.
Srategy - Client has the flexibility to change the behaviour during ruintime by setting a different strategy object context object is composed of.
