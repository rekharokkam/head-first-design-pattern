2 different patterns are covered in this chapter

Definition
----------

Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Design Principle
----------------
Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.

Dependency Inversion Principle - suggests that high-level components should not depend on low-level components, rather both should depend on abstractions.

Comparing Factory Method Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern
-------------------------------------------------------------


FMP - relies on Inheritance.Object creation is delegated to subclasses which encapsulate the logic of generating the concrete products.
AFP - relies on Object Composition. 

FMP - Creates a Single Product
AFP - Creates a family of Products.

Both the Factory Patterns Encapsulate Object Creation.
Both the Patterns promote loose coupling by making the client code depend on interface and not on the concrete Classes. 
There by we also follow the principle - Program to interface and not to implementation .
