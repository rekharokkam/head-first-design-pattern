2 different patterns are covered in this chapter

Definition
----------

Adapter Pattern - Converts the interface of a class into another interface the client expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Facade Pattern - Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Design Guidelines
-----------------
When you need to use an existing class and its interface is not the one needed then use an ADAPTER to change the interface.
When it is needed to simplify and unify a large or complex set of interfaces/subsystem then use a FACADE.

Design Principle
----------------
Principle of Least Knowledge - Talk only to your immediate friends.
For any object, care should be taken for the number of classes the Object interacts with and also how it comes to interact with those classes.

Guidelines by this Principle are :

Consider any Object, now from any method inside of this Object invoke methods that belong to

1) The Object itself
2) Objects passed in as parameter to the method 
3) Any Object created inside the method or instantiated inside the method
4) Any Components of the Object
5) Do not call methods on the objects returned from calling other methods.


Comparison between Adapter and Decorator
----------------------------------------

 Adapter - Wraps an Object(s) to change its interface to some thing client expects.
 Decorator - Wraps an Object to add new behaviours and responsibilities
 Facade - Wraps a set of Objects to simply.
 
 Adapter - Intent is to Alter an interface into the one that a client is expecting.
 Decorator - Doesnt alter the interface but adds additional responsibiity. 
 Facade - Intent is to provide a simplied interface to a complex subsytem
